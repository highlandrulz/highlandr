September is here and having enjoyed a wonderful Summer with my kids it is time to get back into the 
business of helping people solve their IT challenges. At least that's how I like to look at it. As a 
part of my research on what to do next I decided to do some research on strategy.
<!--more-->
To that end I signed myself up for a course called "Strategic Management" from the Copanhagan School of 
Business on Coursera.org. 

## The goal
My thought going into this was to gain a clearer understanding of the current approach to business strategy 
and to see how I might align it to my own field of DevOps strategy development.

## Results
One of the topics I learned about was two of the most influential thinkers in Business strategy for the last 30 years, namely Michael Porter
and Henry Mintzberg. In the 80's Michael Porter set himself up as the master of business strategy and it is his teaching 
that has guided and driven the MBA programs of the following decades. His philosophy focused around competitive 
advantage in the marketplace coming from an understanding of the target market and planning your approach upfront. 
He also called out that being operationally effective would not be sufficient to succeed in a competitive 
market.

Events of the subsequent decades have proved that to not be an entirely true picture and certainly within the technology 
industry, being operationally effective and being able to learn from our customers then quickly modify our products to 
their needs has happened in many other industries. Honda in the mid-90's entered the US market with a motorbike that, 
according to Michael Porter's work, should not have succeeded. However, due their ability to rapidly learn from their 
customers needs and modify their product to meet those needs they successfully created the market they needed to succeed. 

## Summary
I'm siding with Henry Mintzberg on this due to the clear parallels to the adoption of Agile practices and DevOps. 
Supporting our businesses and enabling them to be more operationally effective is our target goal we do this through the 
adoption of modern development practices and tools.

Operations is dead! Long live Operations!

To an extent this may be true but it is important to remember that if you are providing a service, 
knowing the status of that service and ensuring it is
running optimally is still as necessary as it ever was. What has changed is *how* Operations is 
delivered and by *whom*.
<!--more-->
In a rush to divest themselves of "legacy" functions in favor of new "Agile" practices, we are
seeing company’s misstep into situations where they can no longer support their traditional business
services and having weakened their operations practices are left with nobody to pick up the pieces. 

## The "How"
In a traditional organization the Operations team has often set themselves up as the last line of 
defense in protecting the sacred production environment. Without them those *crazy* developers would
wreck havoc and bring production to its knees.

However this approach does not work well with the faster pace of application delivery enabled by modern 
practices and tools. Operations has gone from the saviors of production to the bottleneck in the process.

They still however have a vital role to play, that of understanding and providing visibility into the 
end to end business service that is delivered by the combination of the multiple development teams.

Operations still requires insight to ensure when the inevitable happens and something goes wrong that the
right folks come to the table to work on fixing it.

One approach to help with this is to take a more structured approach to change. Work to understand what it
currently takes to deliver and support the business services you provide before making changes. This also
provides the opportunity to be more targeted in the areas you look to change, handling the low hanging fruit 
first. 

## The "Whom"
With this it is no longer the role and responsibility of a separate group of people to maintain the stability 
of the production environment. That is the responsibility of everybody. 

Bringing the right tooling to bear on those critical points will in turn free up resource time (people and 
technology) to help target the things you truly want to work on. Don't forget though that tools require care
and feeding. Cloud based SaaS services can alleviate some of this but keep in mind that you still need to have 
people who understand your end to end service delivery. 

## Summary
Your operations practice isn’t going away, it just looks different. Parts of it are very likely not run by you
anymore. If anything, it just got a whole lot more complicated.

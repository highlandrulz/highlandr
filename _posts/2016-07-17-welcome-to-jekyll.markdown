There is a lot of talk these days about "NoOps" and the demise of the infrastructure and 
operations teams. 

To an extent this may be true but it is important to remember that if you in in the business 
of providing a service (and we all are), knowing the status of that service and ensuring it is
running optimally is still necessary. 

Neither infrastructure or Operations is going away, however their function may just be fulfilled in a
different manner.

In a rush to divest themselves of "legacy: functions in favour of new "Agile" practices, we are
seeing companies misstep into situations where they can no longer support their traditional business
processes and wind up picking up the pieces. 

One approach to help with this is to take a more strutured approach to change. Work to understand what it
currently takes to deliver and support the buisness services you provide before making changes. This also
provides the opportunity to be more targetted in the areas you look to change, handling the low hanging fruit 
first. 

Brining the right tooling to bear on those critical points wll in turn free up resource time (people and 
technology) to help target the things you truly want to work on. Don't forget though that tools require care
and feeding. Cloud based SaaS services can allieviate some of this but keep in mind that you still need to have 
people who understand your end to end service delivery. 

Your infrastructure isn't going away, it just looks different. Parts of it are very likely not run by you
anymore. If anything, it just got a whole lot more complicated.
